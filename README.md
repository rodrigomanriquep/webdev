 The two books below can be used as references during the course, but they are not required:

Notes: 

- We will use this Udemy Online Learning Resource as a replacement for the traditional textbook for this course due to its much cheaper price and its timeliness.
Web development is a fast-moving field, and there exists no single textbook out there that can cover the latest technologies comprehensively enough. It also refrains students from physically pick up the book especially considering that some students are not in Canada.
